# snow

**snow** is a retro Windows style wlroots-based compositor.

Named after the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 codename, &ldquo;**Snowball**,&rdquo; its primary objective is to look and feel like a Windows 3.x environment under Wayland.

In the future, snow will work either as a dynamic tiler or a stacking window manager, which would be changed in the configuration.
